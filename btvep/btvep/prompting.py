class Prompting(bt.Synapse):
    """
    The Prompting subclass of the Synapse class encapsulates the functionalities related to prompting scenarios.

    It specifies three fields - `roles`, `messages` and `completion` - that define the state of the Prompting object.
    The `roles` and `messages` are read-only fields defined during object initialization, and `completion` is a mutable
    field that can be updated as the prompting scenario progresses.

    The Config inner class specifies that assignment validation should occur on this class (validate_assignment = True),
    meaning value assignments to the instance fields are checked against their defined types for correctness.

    Attributes:
        roles (List[str]): A list of roles in the prompting scenario. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        messages (List[str]): A list of messages in the prompting scenario. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        completion (str): A string that captures completion of the prompt. This field is mutable.
        required_hash_fields List[str]: A list of fields that are required for the hash.

    Methods:
        deserialize() -> "Prompting": Returns the instance of the current object.


    The `Prompting` class also overrides the `deserialize` method, returning the
    instance itself when this method is invoked. Additionally, it provides a `Config`
    inner class that enforces the validation of assignments (`validate_assignment = True`).

    Here is an example of how the `Prompting` class can be used:

    ```python
    # Create a Prompting instance
    prompt = Prompting(roles=["system", "user"], messages=["Hello", "Hi"])

    # Print the roles and messages
    print("Roles:", prompt.roles)
    print("Messages:", prompt.messages)

    # Update the completion
    model_prompt =... # Use prompt.roles and prompt.messages to generate a prompt
    for your LLM as a single string.
    prompt.completion = model(model_prompt)

    # Print the completion
    print("Completion:", prompt.completion)
    ```

    This will output:
    ```
    Roles: ['system', 'user']
    Messages: ['You are a helpful assistant.', 'Hi, what is the meaning of life?']
    Completion: "The meaning of life is 42. Deal with it, human."
    ```

    This example demonstrates how to create an instance of the `Prompting` class, access the
    `roles` and `messages` fields, and update the `completion` field.

    class Config:

        inheriting from this class, it might give a custom implementation for deserialization if need be.
